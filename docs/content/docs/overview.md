RIF is a command-line tool and associated template file-format for storing,
making and sharing HTTP requests. With RIF you can create a `.rif` template file
that contains all the details and parameters of a HTTP request you frequently
have to make (e.g. if you are testing a HTTP API). You can then use RIF to
fire off that request with the desired parameters quickly and easily.

# Why RIF?
## Developers
As a developer, RIF will allow you to take the repetitive strain out of
interacting with and testing HTTP APIs.
You will be able to replay complex HTTP requests with a single command
instead of meticulously hand-editing cURL snippets or hunting through
your bash history.
## QA Engineers
As a QA engineer, RIF will allow you to collaborate with developers on `.rif`
request templates. This will speed up any manual API testing by allowing you
to focus on changing request parameters and finding bugs rather than working
out the details of individual requests.
